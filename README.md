# Experiment-3-Logical-Operators-

In C++, logical operators are used to make decisions based on conditions, especially within control statements like `if`, `while`, and `for`. The three main logical operators are `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT). The logical AND operator (`&&`) returns true only if both conditions being compared are true. For example, the expression `(a > 0 && b > 0)` is true only if both `a` and `b` are greater than zero. The logical OR operator (`||`) returns true if at least one of the conditions is true. For instance, `(a > 0 || b > 0)` evaluates to true even if only one of the variables is positive. Lastly, the logical NOT operator (`!`) is a unary operator that reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, applying `!` makes it false, and vice versa. For example, `!(a < 0)` returns true if `a` is not less than zero. These operators are essential for decision-making in programs and are often combined to form complex conditions.
